//Exercise: Weather Report

//Print the location and temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit based on the users preference. 
//Prefix the temprature with an emoji as follows:

// ğŸ¥µ if temperature in Celsius is above 30
// ğŸ˜Š if temperature in Celsius is between 12 and 30
// ğŸ¥¶ if temperature in Celsius is below 12
// Your output should be in the following format:

// In Vancouver it is currently ğŸ¥¶ 37.4Â°F 
// In New Delhi it is currently ğŸ¥µ 35Â°C 
// In Sydney it is currently ğŸ˜Š 17Â°C 
// In Miami it is currently ğŸ¥µ 104Â°F
// CODE TEMPLATE

let preferCelsius = false;
let tempC = 3;
let location = 'Vancouver';
let emojiFace;
let temperatureString;
if (tempC < 12) {
    emojiFace = 'ğŸ¥¶';
} else if (tempC >= 12 <= 30) {
    emojiFace = "ğŸ˜Š";
} else {
    emojiFace = "ğŸ¥µ";
}

if (preferCelsius === true) {
    temperatureString = tempC + "Â°C";
} else {
    temperatureString = (tempC * 1.8 + 32) + "Â°F";
}
console.log("In " + location + " it is currently " + emojiFace + " " + temperatureString);

// Write your code here
// Tip: Here's how to solve this problem:

// Create a variable called emojiFace and the use an if-else-if expression to set the value to
//"ğŸ¥µ" or "ğŸ˜Š" or "ğŸ¥¶"
// notice that these values are just strings like "Hello" or "Y"
// Create another variable called temperatureString and use an if-else expression to set the
//value to a formatted string like "37.4Â°F" or "17Â°C"

// Combine the variables location, emojiFace and temperatureString into a string which is printed
//to the console
