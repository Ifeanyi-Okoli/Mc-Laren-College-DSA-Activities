// Implement the `guessTheNumberGame` function using prompt, and alert as explained in class.
// The user should have 5 attempts to guess the number chosen by computer.
// After every guess you should give feedback whether `guess was smaller` or `guess was larger`
// If user is not able to guess the number, say "you lose, I was thinking of X"

// Part 1
/*
Breakdown the game into atleast 3 parts that you would complete to buid this game.
For eg: Part 1 can be to take the user input from browser and print it in console.
